first attempts

I am Elena Spielmann, second year MPP. My level of experience with STATA is basic (everything we have learned through the program). I have zero experience with GitHub and SurveyCTO. I have basic experience with R through data visualization. I have been in the Army for over 9 years and will be going back to the Army after I graduate, hopefully with more technical skills invovling coding. 

Create a README.md in your own repo and write a two-paragraph biography of yourself, including your program, your level of experience with Stata, GitHub, and SurveyCTO, and some other basic biographical information of your choice. Save your edits. We recommend you use a text editing software like Atom to do this
